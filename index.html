            Voodoo Shader is a comprehensive graphics framework for powering shaders in multiple programs, during development or after release. 
            Voodoo uses plugins and a shared core to support many games and other applications and is compatible with Direct3D and OpenGL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Voodoo uses a system of core modules and adapters to provide the widest compatibility and best performance possible
            across a wide range of applications and APIs. Voodoo supports both OpenGL and DirectX, using nVidia's Cg language.
            In addition, Voodoo provides a second processing step to provide shaders with easy access to other resources,
            especially textures.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Voodoo core and supported shaders remain constant between target applications and adapters, providing a unified
            set of features and single target for shaders.
        </p>
        <h3>Shader Support</h3>
        <p>
            Voodoo uses nVidia's Cg Toolkit to provide a common, simple shader language and cross-API compiler for widely
            supported shaders. Voodoo shaders run under both OpenGL and DirectX and can scale over a great variety of hardware,
            from OpenGL 1.1 to 4.0 and DirectX 8 to 11. Applications using any of the supported APIs are supported within Voodoo,
            with a near-identical feature set provided across the board.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to fully supporting the Cg language, Voodoo implements a second, internal linking stage to offer more
            powerful features such as deferred rendering and material shaders, with or without original application support.
            Voodoo uses features such as semantics and annotations to provide these features without adding complexity to the
            language or breaking compatibility with other shader tools. Voodoo provides a set of compiler options to allow
            shaders to conditionally compile various levels of support. Voodoo fully supports techniques and passes within a
            shader, as well as various program stages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Access to hardware textures and render information is provided through application-specific adapters, allowing Voodoo
            to be tied tightly into a huge number of new and existing programs.
     
        </p>
        <h3>Support Libraries</h3>
        <p>
            Voodoo provides a number of support libraries, many used within Voodoo. These include the Voodoo dynamic loader
            (capable to dynamically loading the Voodoo core and an adapter into a running process), a simple file system manager
            to streamline resource loading, EasyHook-based function intercept library, comprehensive Unicode string handling, and
            other useful code. These libraries are available for use by code within and outside of the Voodoo project and
            simplify a number of common or complex tasks.
        </p>
        <h3>Testing and Code Quality</h3>
        <p>
            The Voodoo framework covers an immense scope and tackles an intriguing and often complex task. To maximize stability,
            speed and code quality, all code within the Voodoo Shader Framework must meet a strict set of quality-control standards
            and be fully tested before release. Tests are carried out within specialized test suites and target applications.
        </p>
        <h3>Logs and Debugging</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to code testing, Voodoo provides logging libraries to record all actions in detail. The verbosity of the
            log can be customized, with the highest levels recording API calls and their parameters. Errors and warnings
            originating within Voodoo code are always logged, and safeguards are put in place to make sure log data is written to
            disk, even in the event of a fatal error or loss of power.
        </p>
        <p>
            Debug builds of Voodoo are available, as is source code, to aid debugging. Debug builds are built with full symbols
            and additional error checking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Voodoo is also fully compatible with your favorite graphics debugger, including PIX for Windows (DirectX) and
            GLintercept (OpenGL). This also extends to screen capture programs and system tools, and code debuggers. In some
            cases, Voodoo's logging may be able to augment the information from these tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the Github project, a tracker for bugs and features is available and open to all users to submit bugs and logs.
        </p>
        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>
            The entire Voodoo project is heavily documented using doxygen notation. These docs are compiled and uploaded along
            with each code push and release. Everything from the variable syntax to texture load formats to the adapter interface
            are documented in depth, cross-referenced and any potential issues are noted. The documentation is interwoven in the
            source, so it is kept up-to-date and extensive and new code is documented as it's written.
