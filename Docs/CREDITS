This file is an attempt to recognize everyone who helped with or contributed to
the Voodoo Shader project in any way. I will try to note everyone and their
contribution, in no particular order, but if I make any mistakes, please let me
know. 


-- Naming and brainstorming:

Mireneye from the BethSoft forums for suggesting Voodoo for the base name.
	This is a nod to the old graphics cards and 3DFX. Without them, who knows if
	any of us would be in this mess today.
	
Anonytroll, from the #morrowind IRC, and Mireneye contributed the basis for
	the Morrowind module (the original suggestion was AGEM).
	
J-Dawg from F3Underground contributed the names for the Fallout 3 and
	Oblivion modules (Raven and Sigil, respectively) one night in the IRC.
	
Zebranky from the NWNX project contributed the NWN2 module name, Shard (same
	night, in #nwn2cr).

Thanks as well to all the other people who helped brainstorm names, without
	checking my IRC logs or learning the alphabet:
		Archie, brianmeyerdesign, Phantasma (awesome suggestions), Akavit,
		Cathartis, Zebranky, J-Dawg, Sethan, ...
	
-- Code and tech:

Timeslip, d4w, phal, krzymark, LizTail and all the others who worked on MGE. It
	is an insane feat of engineering and a testament to your skill that all those
	thousands of lines of undocumented, mysterious code can actually run. ;)
	Working	on MGE was definitely something I enjoyed.
	
phal deserves a second mention for getting depth into shaders in MGE back in
	the day, that was quite a feat and inspired me to not take D3D9's no for an
	answer in Voodoo.
	
virusman, Zebranky and some of the other NWNX folks for helping me get into the
	NWN	engine and make sense of that. Scripting in NWN would never have happened 
	without some of the suggestions and snippets you gave me.
	
The BioWare developers who gave us the NWN linker map. Without that, I would
	have been lost, even with Zebranky and Skywing's help.
	
Skywing for his code and the unending days of confusion it gave me. ;) It also
	simplified NWN's message processing by a huge amount and saved me tons of
	time.
	
Nostrebor and Zebranky from the EA/BioWare social forums, for contributing
	patches for a few annoying bugs in NWShader. Your suggestions and code pointed
	out things I never would've caught, and some of them you fixed for me. Thanks
	to you both.
	
Azorbix et al for the Tatnium D3D9 starter kit. Your wrapper saved me a ton of
	time


-- Inspiration: (oh gods, so many people)

Fliggerty of Great House Fliggerty, for a general disbelief in the 
	classification "impossible" and occasionally encouraging my insanity. The best
	idea? Nah. Epic? Absolutely. Best wishes to you, Shmiggerty and baby Callie.     
	
All the NWShader alpha and beta testers, including Gonzo_og, Inayity, ... and
	all the others. You found more bugs than I could have, almost more than I
	could fix at times. What I learned from that project made this one possible.
	
The various folks who bounced ideas back at me, which only encouraged this. 
	Skywing and Zebranky, you both influenced the project. 
	
The Morrowind and Neverwinter Nights communities, for their interest and warm
	reception of MGE and NWShader (after a little selling ;) ). If not for the
	continued encouragement from you all, none of this would have ever happened.
	
The game studios that brought us all these games I've so cruelly abused. 
		BioWare for Neverwinter Nights
		Bethesda Softworks for Morrowind, Oblivion and Fallout 3
		Obsidian for Neverwinter Nights 2 and Fallout: New Vegas
	I'd love to meet you guys, you've all done some great work. I've seen a few
	comments from developers in some of my BioBoards and other threads, you guys
	even noticing my work is reason enough to keep going.
	 
	Without you all, none of this would be possible (seriously).
	
The studios who inspired me, with their clever or downright awesome graphics.
		xxx (the STALKER series, some insanely good shaders)
		CryTek (the Crysis engine and some of your published docs)
		
The presenters are SIGGRAPH, AI-something and GDC. I hope to one day come to
	your conventions; until then, I'll be searching your papers for anything new
	and awesome (and finding plenty).

Timeslip for creating MGE, the reason I started down this road at all.
	Indirectly, he was the reason I learned C++, DirectX, OpenGL, and almost
	everything technical and useful I know today. And I don't even know the man.
	
xxx from the TES Alliance forums, for working with me to port an early version
	of my trueBloom shader to the Oblivion graphics extender. That was the start
	of this crazy many-game idea. If you had known what you would cause... :P

C. S. Goto for a quote I've had in my forum signatures for some time:
	"Unlikely and impossible are allied,  but not identical." 
	I think the quote was actually referring to some form of siege in a 40k
	book, but I hijacked it and applied it to modding.   
	
So, so many bands that have braced up my questionable sanity during long days,
	nights, and unidentifiable time periods of coding. A few that I listened to
	repeatedly: The Agonist, Assemblage 23, Apoptygma Berzerk, Concrete Blonde, 
	Cult of Luna, Delain, Emilie Autumn, Flogging Molly, Hungry Lucy, In Flames,
	Porcelain and The Tramps, Seraphim Shock, Tiamat and Xandria. You'll never
	know it, but you contributed to making this a reality.     

The people who put up with my nonsensical rants and ridiculous comments. There 
	are plenty of you, so I'll just name channels and forums:
		#elderscrolls, #morrowind, #nwn2cr, #projectq, #ghf, the MW
		modding Skype channel, TES Alliance forums, Great House
		Fliggerty forums, BethSoft forums, BioBoards, EA/BioWare social, and 
		many others over the years. You can all be proud that, in some small
		way, this is all your fault. ;)
	The Unforgotten Realms and Forum of the Dead get a special mention, since
		neither are around any longer, but were some of the first communities I was
		involved in for modding. Any old members of those, hit me up and we'll go for
		beers. :)
