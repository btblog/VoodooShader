    <h2><img src="voodoo.png" style="display:block" alt="Voodoo Shader Framework" />Readme (v0.2.3.143)</h2>
    <h3><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
    <p>The Voodoo Shader Framework is a comprehensive support system for shader effects. It is designed to be used with a number of graphics API and programs, as well as game modding.</p>
    <p>Voodoo is made up of two main parts. The core contains the shader loading and initialization algorithms, as well as some universal management features. Each game or program using Voodoo then provides an adapter, which handles the details of attaching the Voodoo core with a particular program's graphics system.</p>
    <h3><a name="prereq">Prerequisites</a></h3>
    <p>The Voodoo Shader Framework requires a few additional files to run properly. These include:
        <ul>
            <li>Microsoft Visual C++ <strong>2010</strong> Runtime (x86)</li>
            <li>Latest drivers for your video card</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Voodoo log viewer requires the Microsoft .Net framework 3.5 and Internet Explorer 5.0 or better installed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some Voodoo adapters may require OpenGL drivers or the DirectX 9.0c, 10 or 11 runtimes to be installed, as well as Voodoo plugins. These additional dependencies are indicated in the adapter documentation.
    </p>		
    <h3><a name="install_core">Installing the Core</a></h3>
    <p>The Voodoo Core comes with a small installation wizard. The wizard installs all the necessary files and creates the registry key with the Voodoo path. The wizard should easily handle all installation steps for the core.</p>
    <p>The installer does not need administrative permission to run, but if run by a typical user, the Voodoo installation <em>will only work for that user</em>. Administrators can install a system-wide copy of the Voodoo core. Per-user copies will be preferred over system copies, if both are present.</p>
    <p>The registry key is required for adapters to locate the core; it holds the current location of the Voodoo core (and may contain other data in the future). The other possible solutions were either complicated, dangerous for stability, messy or buggy. Using a registry key, while somewhat unpopular, is clean, safe and seemingly quite stable.</p>
    <p>There is no automatic update utility at the moment, although one may be created in the future. Updating the core will require downloading and installing the latest files.</p>
    <h3><a name="install_adapter">Installing Adapters</a></h3>
    <p>Once the Voodoo Core has been installed, additional adapters may be installed for any supported program you would like to use Voodoo with. Adapters may use install wizards or require manual installation. Some adapters may require a minimum version of the Voodoo core to function.</p>
    <p>For adapters with installers, you should run the installer and follow the instructions. These will usually automatically detect the Voodoo core path and any other locations, then install the necessary files. Some adapters may require additional support files (the DirectX adapters require the latest DirectX runtimes).</p>
    <p>For adapters without installers, you should extract the archive to a temporary folder and find the readme. This should contain instructions on how to install the adapter files. You may need to know the locations of the Voodoo core and other programs on your system, and should have permission to add files to those locations. Most Voodoo adapter DLLs go in a <tt>bin</tt> folder inside the main Voodoo folder.</p>
    <h3><a name="running">Running Voodoo</a></h3>
    <p>Once you have the Voodoo core and any chosen adapters installed, whenever you run supported program, Voodoo should be automatically used.</p>
    <p>Shortcuts and other launcher applications should (depending on how they handle things) launch the program with Voodoo enabled. If you find a launcher which does not, or run into a problem, please report it immediately.</p>
    <h3><a name="uninstall">Uninstallation</a></h3>
    <p>To remove the Voodoo core, you should run the included uninstaller. This can be access from the Voodoo folder or through the start menu (if you chose to add the start menu shortcuts).</p>
    <p>To uninstall Voodoo adapters, you should run the adapter-specific uninstaller (if the adapter used an installation wizard) or follow any instructions in the readme.</p>
    <p>To temporarily disable Voodoo for a specific program, you should usually remove or rename the hook DLL (for the DirectX 8.9 and 9.0 hooks, this is a small file named <tt>d3d8.dll</tt> or <tt>d3d9.dll</tt>). This will disable Voodoo for this program until you restore the hook.</p>
