This file is an attempt to recognize everyone who helped with or contributed to
the Voodoo Shader project in any way. I will try to note everyone and their
contribution, in no particular order, but if I make any mistakes, please let me
know. 


Code:

Skywing for a few suggestions and part of the Frost/NWN1 script interface.
Zebranky and Nostrebor from the Bioware forums for NWShader patches that have
	been used in Frost.
virusman, Zebranky and Skywing for pointers in getting into the NWN1 engine,
	used in NWShader and Frost.
	
Timeslip, d4w, phal, krzymark, LizTail and the others who worked on MGE and the
	original D3D8 to 9 layer there.
	
phal deserves a second mention for originally getting depth into MGE, the
	methods there influence the D3D9 adapters.
	
	
Names, brainstorming, suggestions and similar:

Mireneye from the Bethsoft Official forums for suggesting the Voodoo name, as
	a nod to 3DFX and the old cards.
Mireneye and Anonytroll for the basis of the Gem name (MW)
J-Dawg from F3Underground for the Sigil and Raven names (Obv and FO3)
Zebranky for the Shard name (NWN2)

Archie, Akavit, brianmeyerdesign, Cathartis, Phantasma, Sethan and others for
	suggestions that didn't end up being used. Some of them were awesome though.
	
	
	
Wolf from the Great House Fliggerty forums for being one of the first to request 
	a many-game shader app.
	
shadeMe for working with me to convert trueBloom to OBGE, a task that showed why
	this sort of thing was needed.
	
Timeslip for starting MGE and inadvertently triggering this whole thing.
