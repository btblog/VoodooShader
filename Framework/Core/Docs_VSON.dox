      * @page voodoo_vson VSON
      *
      * In order to concisely express objects and other information in files, as well as provide an alternate parser for
      * effect files where the standard HLSL compiler is not available, Voodoo Shader uses a simple object notation. In a
      * futile attempt to be "cool", this is named VSON, and similar in some ways to JSON (it is, however, far less 
      * verbose and constrained).
      *
      * This page details the basics of VSON. For language purposes, it is the standard specification.
      *
      * @section voodoo_vson_general General
      *
      * In order to be compatible with HLSL, VSON @a is case-sensitive and files are parsed as ASCII. Later versions may
      * have support for Unicode character ranges, but the minimum goals do not use these. Whitespace and newlines are not 
      * significant, except within quoted strings; spaces or tabs may be used to indent lines and delimeters may be placed
      * on the same or following lines.
      *
      * @section voodoo_vson_types Types
      * VSON uses a small number of primitive types, all represented in plaintext. Types may be given explicitly or inferred
      * from the value, like so:
      *
      * @code
      * flag  = false           // Infered boolean
      * boolean iflag = 0;      // Explicit boolean
      * number = 37000          // Inferred integer
      * integer trunc = 394.37  // Explicit integer, truncates decimal
      * fraction = 803.5        // Inferred decimal
      * name = "Example"        // Inferred string
      * @endcode
      *
      * @subsection voodoo_vson_types_boolean boolean
      * The <tt>boolean</tt> type is a simple binary type. It can represent the values true or false.
      *
      * @par Representation:
      *     @code (true|false) @endcode
      *     The unquoted keywords @a true and @a false are interpreted as a boolean. To use the numeric representation, the 
      *     type must be explicitly given.
      *
      * @par Conversion:
      *     All other types can be converted to <tt>boolean</tt>. For numeric types, this is performed as <tt>x > 0</tt>, so
      *     0 is retained (becoming false) and all positive values become 1 (for unsigned, this is all values other than 0).
      *     For strings, this is <tt>!x.IsEmpty()</tt>, so strings with any value are considered true. Objects always
      *     convert to true.
      *
      * @subsection voodoo_vson_types_integer integer
      * The <tt>integer</tt> type is a 64-bit signed integer. It can represent values from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 
      * +9,223,372,036,854,775,807, or approximately 19 digits.
      *
      * @par Representation:
      *     @code [-+]?([0-9]+) @endcode
      *     Any unquoted numeric value not containing a decimal point (the <tt>.</tt> character) is considered to be an
      *     integer. Integers may be padded with leading zeroes (trailing zeros are significant) and may begin with a sign.
      *
      * @par Conversion:
      *     The <tt>bool</tt> and <tt>decimal</tt> types may be converted to <tt>int</tt>. <tt>bool</tt> is converted to
      *     1 or 0 when true or false, respectively. <tt>decimal</tt> is truncated to the integral part and clamped to the
      *     minimum or maximum value <tt>integer</tt> can represent, where necessary.
      *
      * @subsection voodoo_vson_types_decimal decimal
      * The <tt>decimal</tt> type is a 64-bit double, following the IEEE 754 standard for @a binary64. The <tt>dec</tt> is a
      * floating-point type with variable precision, having a range of approximately +/–1.7E308 with at least 15 digits of 
      * precision
      *
      * @par Representation:
      *     @code [-+]?([0-9]+\.[0-9]*) @endcode
      *     Any unquoted numeric value containing a decimal point (the <tt>.</tt> character) is considered to be a decimal. 
      *     Decimals may be padded with zeroes, including starting and ending with them. Decimals may end with a decimal 
      *     point, although they must begin with a digit or sign.
      *
      * @par Conversion:
      *     The <tt>boolean</tt> and <tt>integer</tt> types may be converted to <tt>decimal</tt>. <tt>boolean</tt> will be
      *     converted to 1 or 0 for true or false, respectively. <tt>integer</tt> will be used as-is whenever possible; due
      *     to how decimals are handled, rounding may occur and may be significant for large values.
      *
      * @warning Converting between <tt>integer</tt> and <tt>decimal</tt>, for extremely large numbers, can cause loss of
      *     precision. This is a characteristic of the floating-point type.
      *     
      * @subsection voodoo_vson_types_string string
      * The <tt>string</tt> type is an arbitrary-length character array, capable of holding any ASCII characters. Strings
      * have a length limit of 2 billion characters.
      *
      * @par Representation:
      *     @code \".*\" @endcode
      *     Any quoted value. Inline quotes and special characters must be escaped.
      *
      * @par Conversion:
      *     All other types can be converted to <tt>string</tt>. <tt>boolean</tt> is converted to "true" or "false", numeric
      *     types are converted to their standard representation (for example, <tt>integer 13</tt> would be "13" and
      *     <tt>decimal 13.57</tt> would be "13.57"). This is identical to the mechanic used during serialization.
      *
      * @subsection voodoo_vson_types_parsed parsed
      * The <tt>parsed</tt> type is a special-behavior string. During loading, it is run through IParser::Parse with default
      * flags, and follows all standard variable rules (including specifying flags in a variable). The result of the parsing
      * is converted to a string and used as the value.
      *
      * @note The initial string for a <tt>parsed</tt> is retained for serialization purposes, but not exposed directly. If
      *     the value is set on an object during runtime, the new value replaces the initial string, is parsed, and the
      *     result again becomes the public value. This allows <tt>parsed</tt> to retain its value across serialization.
      *
      * @par Representation: 
      *     Due to having the same form as <tt>string</tt>, <tt>parsed</tt> must always have the type explicitly given.
      *     Strings not marked as <tt>parsed</tt> will never be interpreted as such. Otherwise, it is identical to 
      *     <tt>string</tt>.
      *
      * @par Conversion:
      *     The same conversion rules apply to <tt>parsed</tt> as to <tt>string</tt>.
      *
      * @section voodoo_vson_scope Scope
      * Scopes in VSON are marked with braces (<tt>{</tt> and <tt>}</tt>). Scope may only change at certain points:
      * @ul
      *  @li The beginning and end of a file (implicit document scope).
      *  @li An object declaration (explicit object scope).
      *
      * Explicit scopes must have braces, implicit scopes do not.
      *
      * @section voodoo_vson_elements Elements
      * The VSON language is remarkably concise, containing of only four primary elements. For compatibility, both standard
      * HLSL comment types are allowed:
      *
      * @code
      * // Trailing comment
      * /* Region comment */
      * @endcode
      *
      * Trailing comments last until the end of the current line, while region comments may be used inline. Region comments
      * may not be nested.
      *
      * @subsection voodoo_vson_elements_directive Directive
      * Directive elements give special instructions to the VSON processor, particularly marking chunks of the file as being
      * literal or ignored. All directives must be alone on their line, with the exception of trailing comments, and the
      * first characters of the line must be the sequence <tt>//!</tt> (whitespace between the directive and the initial 
      * sequence is allowed, newlines are not).
      *
      * Available directives include:
      *
      * @subsubsection voodoo_vson_elements_directive_bang Bang
      * @code
      * //! VSON
      * @endcode
      * This directive indicates that the entire document, except parts marked as literal or ignored, should be parsed as
      * VSON. This is only valid on the first line of a file. If it is not present, the file is parsed as if it was framed
      * by literal directives. 
      *
      * Lack of a bang does @a not prevent the document scope from being created, it simply implies a literal region. Any
      * parsed regions within a document missing a bang will be parsed into the document scope as usual.
      *
      * @subsubsection voodoo_vson_elements_directive_literal Literal
      * @code
      * \//! [[
      * /\/! [[
      * //\! [[
      * ...
      * //! ]]
      * @endcode
      * The region between the directives will not be parsed as VSON, regardless of document settings. It will instead be 
      * assigned to the @a value property of the current scope. In the case of HLSL, this is useful for embedding source 
      * code in the document scope. This directive's symbol is inspired by the XML CDATA marker.
      *
      * @subsubsection voodoo_vson_elements_directive_parsed Parsed
      * @code
      * //\! {{
      * ...
      * //! }}
      * @endcode
      * The region between the directives will be parsed as VSON, regardless of document settings. It will be added to the
      * current scope, typically being the document scope (see the notes on @ref voodoo_vson_elements_directive_bang). It is
      * possible to nest literal and parsed regions within a document (with or without bang), but this is not recommended, 
      * as simply closing the scope is usually clearer. This directive's symbol indicates the region is in a VSON scope.
      *
      * @subsection voosoo_vson_elements_identifier Identifier
      * Identifiers are used to name types and properties. They may contain any number of alphanumeric characters or
      * underscores, but must start with a letter. Identifiers are not quoted. Keywords are all identifiers.
      *
      * @subsection voodoo_vson_elements_property Property
      * Properties are named values within a scope. During parsing, they are assigned to the enclosing scope's properties
      * map, keyed by name, and may be retrieved or changed later.
      *
      * @par Representation:
      *     @code [type] name = value; @endcode
      *     @a name must be an identifier and unique within this scope.
      *     @a value must be a valid representation of @type. If @type is not specified, it is implied from the first type 
      *     for which @a value is valid (tested as boolean, decimal, boolean, string).
      *     Properties must have a trailing semicolon.
      *
      * @par Conversion:
      *     Properties may be converted to <tt>string</tt>, where they will appear as given in the representation (including
      *     spacing). This is used during serialization.
      *
      * @subsection voodoo_vson_elements_object Object
      * Objects are custom-typed objects with an optional named. Objects create a new scope when declared and may belong to
      * another scope, either document or object (they may be nested).
      *
      * @par Representation:
      *     @code 
      * type ["name"]
      * {
      *     ...
      * }[;]
      *     @endcode
      *     @a type must be an identifier, but need not be unique within this scope.
      *     @a name is an optional string. It is recommended that it be unique within this scope, but is not required to be.
      *     Following the declaration, a new scope for this object is created, and properties and objects may be nested.
      *     Objects do not need a trailing semicolon, although they may optionally have one; the object ends at the closing
      *     brace regardless.
      *
      * @par Conversion:
      *     Objects may be converted to <tt>string</tt>, where they will appear as given in the representation (including
      *     spacing and indentation). Objects with no name (or where name is an empty string) will not have a name in string
      *     form. This is used during serialization.
      *
