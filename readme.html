<h2>Voodoo Shader Framework</h2>

<h3>version 0.5.2 - alpha</h3>

<h4><a href="http://www.voodooshader.com">VoodooShader.com</a></h4>

<hr>

<h3>1. Summary</h3>

<p>Voodoo Shader improves and extends graphics in old and new games. It's fast, stable, open-source, and runs on ATi/AMD and 
nVidia with DirectX or OpenGL.</p>

<p>Voodoo uses a system of core modules and adapters to provide the widest compatibility and best performance possible across a
wide range of applications and APIs. This core framework remains constant between target applications and adapters,
 providing a unified set of features and single target for shaders.</p>

<p>Voodoo supports both OpenGL and DirectX, from older versions to the latest release. Shaders are developed using the Cg
language, allowing a single shader to run on nearly all graphics systems.</p>

<h3>2. Installation</h3>

<p>The Voodoo system function using a core-and-adapter model. The Voodoo core handles most vital functions, and
program-specific adapters interface with each program in detail. The core and all bundled basic plugins are refered to as
the Voodoo framework (it is possible to use the core without any framework plugins, but they are recommended).</p>

<p>To install the Voodoo framework, you need to download and run the Voodoo Package Manager. This will check for and create
installation information and offer a list of available packages. It is highly recommended you select the Voodoo Framework
package to install, along with any others you may need.</p>

<h3>3. Modules &amp; Adapters</h3>

<p>After the Voodoo framework is installed, you will need to install adapters for any game you want to use Voodoo in. Various
adapters are available for a number of Direct3D 8, 9 and OpenGL games.</p>

<p>Adapters and other modules may be downloaded or updated from the Voodoo UI. These are listed in the download manager window.</p>

<p>Third-party modules may be downloaded with the UI by adding additional remote locations. <em>Care should be taken when using
modules from third parties, as they may be unsafe. No support is given for third-party modules, nor do Voodoo license terms
apply. Make sure you read all documentation carefully and don't use modules from untrusted sources.</em></p>

<h3>4. Running Voodoo</h3>

<p>Voodoo has two major modes of operation.</p>

<p>The primary and preferred mode is for the Voodoo UI to be running. This will automatically load into any applications for
which a hook is present and active. Hooks may be managed within the UI.</p>

<p>The secondary method is to drop the Voodoo intercept DLL into the game directory. This is significantly more limited, but
does not require the UI to be running. Hooks must still be defined for the application.</p>

<p>Once the game has been hooked, Voodoo will automatically load itself and all plugins given in the config file. Behavior
after this depends on the modules used.</p>

<h3>5. Reporting Bugs</h3>
