 1. Gem Info

Voodoo/Gem is the adapter for The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind (a RPG by
Bethesda Softworks). Gem enables some test shader functions within Morrowind.

GEM SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED STABLE AT THIS POINT. THIS IS PURELY FOR BASIC
TESTING PURPOSES.

 2. Installing Gem

The Gem package comes with 4 files: the hook module (d3d8.dll), the Gem adapter
(Voodoo_Gem.dll), a test shader (test.cgfx) and this readme (README).

The hook and test shader should be placed in the same location as Morrowind.exe
(your Morrowind directory). The readme may be placed here as well, but you
might want to rename it.

The adapter should be placed in the Voodoo binary directory (if the Voodoo
core was installed to C:\VoodooShader, the binary directory is 
C:\VoodooShader\bin).

If you receive an error related to the Gem hook, or a DLL not found error, the
hook is properly installed but cannot find the adapter module.

 3. Disabling Gem

To temporarily disable Voodoo/Gem and remove all Voodoo features from
Morrowind, you should remove or rename the hook file (d3d8.dll) in the
Morrowind directory. Renaming this file to anything other than d3d8.dll will
disable Voodoo/Gem entirely.

 4. Uninstalling Gem

To permanently remove Voodoo/Gem, you should delete the 4 files that were
installed. The hook (d3d8.dll) and test shader (test.cgfx) should both be in
your Morrowind directory, the adapter (Voodoo_Gem.dll) should be in your
Voodoo binary directory, and the readme may be in your Morrowind directory.

 5. Contact/Usage
