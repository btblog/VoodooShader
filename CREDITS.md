## Voodoo Shader Credits

This file is an attempt to recognize everyone who helped with or contributed to the Voodoo Shader project in any way. I will 
try to note everyone and their contribution, in no particular order, but if I make any mistakes, please let me know.


### Code:
* Skywing for a few suggestions in general, part of the Frost/NWN1 script interface and a lot of Shard/NWN2 stuff.
* Zebranky and Nostrebor from the Bioware forums for NWShader patches that have been used in Frost.
* virusman, Zebranky and Skywing for pointers in getting into the NWN1 engine, used in NWShader and Frost.

* Timeslip, d4w, phal, krzymark, LizTail and the others who worked on MGE and the original D3D8 to 9 layer there.
* phal deserves a second mention for originally getting depth into MGE, the methods there influence the D3D8.9 adapters.

### Names, brainstorming, advice and such:
* Knots, Danke, arvisrend, Cat, Haplo, Lokey and others for comments and opinions on the UI.
* Mireneye from the Bethsoft Official forums for suggesting the Voodoo name, as a nod to 3DFX and the old cards.
* Mireneye and Anonytroll for the basis of the Gem name (MW)
* J-Dawg from F3Underground for the Sigil and Raven names (Obv and FO3)
* Zebranky for the Shard name (NWN2)
* Archie, Akavit, brianmeyerdesign, Cathartis, Phantasma, Sethan and others for name suggestions that didn't end up being
  used. Some of them were awesome though.

### Various other contributions:
* Knots, Lusit, and the other SFN and #morrowind folks for general discussion and suggestions and making sure progress was 
  being made.
* Wolf from the Great House Fliggerty forums for being one of the first to request a many-game shader app.
* shadeMe for working with me to convert trueBloom to OBGE, a task that showed why this sort of thing was needed.
* Timeslip for starting MGE and inadvertently triggering this whole thing.
