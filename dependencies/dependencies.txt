Voodoo relies on a number of third-party libraries for various functions. This directory contains 
the necessary files for most of these.

Significant (not included) dependencies include:

 * Boost 1.48.0
 * nVidia's Cg Toolkit (February 2011)
 * DirectX 9.0c SDK (August 2010)

These cannot be included due to license terms or size, but may be downloaded from:

 * http://www.boost.org
 * http://www.microsoft.com
 * http://www.nvidia.com

The dependencies are in a ZIP archive and must be extracted before use (having them loose greatly 
increases the repo size). Win32 builds are included (DLL and LIB files) and the projects are set up 
to use this dir for most dependencies. The archive should be extracted into this directory.

Included are:

 * DevIL 1.7.8 (32-bit)
 * EasyHook 2.6
 * Glew 1.5.7
 * MarkdownSharp 1.13
 * NDesk.Options 0.2.1
 * pugixml 1.0 (32-bit)
