Voodoo relies on a number of third-party libraries for various functions. This directory contains 
the necessary files for of these.

Two significant (not included) dependencies also exist:
 - nVidia's Cg Toolkit (June 2010)
 - DirectX 9.0c SDK (August 2010)

These cannot be included due to license terms, but may be downloaded from http://www.nvidia.com and
http://www.microsoft.com, respectively.

The dependencies are in a ZIP archive and must be extracted before use (having them loose greatly 
increases the repo size). Win32 builds are included (DLL and LIB files) and the projects are set up 
to use this dir for most dependencies.
